## SimBBA Engine V3

### This version of the SimBBA Version has been refacatored for easier development, improved efficiency, and easier to keep track of changes.

### FOR TESTING, PLEASE SET THE TESTING VARIABLE TO TRUE

### All Required files for getting data from the SimNBA API should be readily available. If there are any changes needed to the data, look in the teamclasses file and the play_by_play collector.

#### This Engine was written by Ezaco and Wahoo, co-written by me (TuscanSota). I do not want to take full credit for this, as the changes I made were to ensure the data received from the API matches with what the objects for the engine are required.
